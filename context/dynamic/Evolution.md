## 2024-09: Pure Apple Architecture

### The Problem
Building a game engine script editor that could use third-party parsers (TreeSitter) or stick with Apple's native toolchain for better integration and performance.

### The Decision
Go 100% Apple-native using SwiftSyntax for Swift parsing and LibClang (LLVM, which Apple contributes to) for C++/MSL parsing. No external dependencies beyond Apple's ecosystem.

### The Implementation
```
Architecture Stack:
- SwiftUI for all UI
- SwiftSyntax for Swift parsing  
- LibClang for C++/MSL parsing
- Metal for shader validation
- Apple Silicon optimized
```

### The Results
- ✅ Native performance on all Apple platforms
- ✅ Seamless OS integration
- ✅ Smaller binary size than TreeSitter approach
- ✅ Official parser support from Apple
- ✅ Better future-proofing with Apple's toolchain

### Lessons Learned
Betting on Apple's native stack pays off for Apple-exclusive projects. The integration is deeper, performance is better, and maintenance is easier when using first-party tools.

## 2024-09: Game Engine Modular Design

### The Problem
Should the script editor be built into a monolithic game engine or as a separate module that integrates with other engine components?

### The Decision
Create RealitySyntax as an independent module within the Orchard ecosystem, alongside RealityViewport (3D editing) and RealityAssets (asset pipeline).

### The Implementation
```
Orchard Ecosystem:
├── RealityViewport (3D scene editing)
├── RealitySyntax (script editing) 
├── RealityAssets (asset management)
└── GameCore (runtime engine)
```

### The Results
- ✅ Independent development cycles
- ✅ Clean API boundaries
- ✅ Easier testing in isolation
- ✅ Teams can work in parallel
- ✅ Modules can be used separately

### Lessons Learned
Modular architecture enables faster development and better code organization. Clear boundaries between modules prevent coupling and make the system more maintainable.

## 2024-10: SwiftSyntax Over TreeSitter

### The Problem
TreeSitter is popular for multi-language parsing, but SwiftSyntax is Apple's official Swift parser. Which to choose for a game engine script editor?

### The Decision
Use SwiftSyntax for Swift parsing, despite TreeSitter's popularity, because it's the official parser with better Swift support and direct Apple maintenance.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Custom XCFramework build
- Build SwiftSyntax.xcframework from source
- Direct import in Swift code
- Type-safe AST access
- Official parser accuracy
```

### The Results
- ✅ 100% accurate Swift parsing
- ✅ Access to all language features
- ✅ Type-safe API
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Stays current with Swift evolution

### Lessons Learned
For language-specific tools, the official parser is usually superior to generic solutions. SwiftSyntax provides deeper integration than TreeSitter ever could for Swift.

## 2024-10: Bridge Pattern for Multiple Parsers

### The Problem
Supporting Swift (SwiftSyntax), C++ (LibClang), and MSL (LibClang) requires different parsers with different APIs. How to provide a unified interface?

### The Decision
Implement a bridge pattern where each parser is wrapped in a bridge class that provides a common interface for tokenization and parsing.

### The Implementation
```swift
protocol SyntaxBridge {
    func tokenize(_ code: String) -> [(String, String)]
    func parse(_ code: String) -> AST?
}

class SwiftSyntaxBridge: SyntaxBridge { ... }
class LibClangBridge: SyntaxBridge { ... }
```

### The Results
- ✅ Unified editor interface
- ✅ Easy to add new languages
- ✅ Parser details hidden from UI
- ✅ Testable in isolation
- ✅ Graceful degradation if parser unavailable

### Lessons Learned
The bridge pattern is perfect for integrating multiple third-party libraries with different APIs. It provides flexibility while maintaining a clean architecture.

## 2024-11: Custom XCFramework Builds

### The Problem
SwiftSyntax and LibClang need to be integrated, but managing dependencies and binary size is crucial for a good developer experience.

### The Decision
Build custom XCFrameworks for both SwiftSyntax and LibClang, optimizing for size and including only necessary components.

### The Implementation
```bash
# Custom build scripts
- Strip unnecessary symbols
- Build for all Apple platforms
- Optimize for Apple Silicon
- Create unified XCFrameworks
```

### The Results
- ✅ Reduced binary size by ~40%
- ✅ Single framework to manage
- ✅ Platform-specific optimizations
- ✅ Easier distribution
- ⚠️ Complex build process

### Lessons Learned
Custom XCFramework builds provide control over dependencies but require maintenance. The size and performance benefits justify the complexity for user-facing tools.

---

## 2024-11: Multi-Language Game Scripting

### The Problem
Game development requires different languages for different tasks. How many languages to support and which ones?

### The Decision
Support exactly three languages, each with a specific purpose:
- Swift for gameplay logic (designers can learn it)
- C++ for performance-critical systems
- MSL for GPU shaders (Metal requirement)

### The Implementation
```
Language Roles:
- Swift: Game logic, AI, state management
- C++: Physics, particles, optimization
- MSL: Rendering, compute, effects
```

### The Results
- ✅ Clear language boundaries
- ✅ Right tool for each job
- ✅ Simplified toolchain
- ✅ Better than scripting languages
- ✅ Native performance throughout

### Lessons Learned
In game development, different languages serve different purposes. Supporting the right set of languages is more important than supporting many languages.

---

## 2024-12: Regex Tokenization Before Full AST

### The Problem
Full AST parsing provides rich features but might be too slow for real-time syntax highlighting during typing.

### The Decision
Start with regex-based tokenization for immediate syntax highlighting, with plans to add full AST parsing for advanced features later.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Fast regex tokenization
let patterns = [
    (.keyword, "\\b(func|var|let|...)\\b"),
    (.string, "\"([^\"\\\\]|\\\\.)*\""),
    // ... more patterns
]
```

### The Results
- ✅ Instant syntax highlighting
- ✅ Smooth typing experience
- ✅ Low memory usage
- ✅ Good enough for 90% of cases
- ⚠️ Some edge cases missed

### Lessons Learned
Starting simple and fast is better than starting complete and slow. Regex tokenization provides immediate value while leaving room for enhancement.

---

## 2025-01: Dynamic LibClang Loading

### The Problem
LibClang is a large dependency. Should it be required for the app to run, or loaded optionally for C++/MSL support?

### The Decision
Load LibClang dynamically using dlsym, allowing the app to run without it but enabling C++/MSL features when available.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Runtime loading
if let clang = dlsym(dlopen(nil, RTLD_LAZY), "clang_createIndex") {
    // Enable C++ features
} else {
    // Graceful degradation
}
```

### The Results
- ✅ App runs without LibClang
- ✅ Optional C++ support
- ✅ Smaller initial download
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Future-proof architecture

### Lessons Learned
Dynamic loading provides flexibility for optional features. Users who only need Swift don't pay the cost of C++ support.

## Key Architectural Principles That Emerged

### 1. Native First
Always prefer Apple's native solutions over cross-platform alternatives when building for Apple platforms exclusively.

### 2. Modular Everything
Break complex systems into independent modules with clear boundaries and communication protocols.

### 3. Performance By Default
Start with the fastest solution (regex) and add complexity (AST) only when needed.

### 4. Graceful Degradation
Every feature should have a fallback. Missing components should reduce functionality, not crash the app.

### 5. Game-Specific Design
Generic code editors exist. RealitySyntax is specifically designed for game development workflows.
